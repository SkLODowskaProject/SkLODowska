Sorbonne (Q214654) => "Historical university building in Paris, France"

Issue n.3: the Noble Prize Medal
Since the two medals have been melted down(at the start of World War I, France put out a call for gold to fund the war effort, so Curie offered to have her two medals melted down), what we have today as an evidence of the prize is the two documents attesting the prize. We manage to find the documents recorded, especially on the Nobel website, but without succeeding.
