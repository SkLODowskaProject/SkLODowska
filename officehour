Issue n.1: Geographical coordinates

Issue n.2: Sorbonne (on Wikidata, it is described as a university, a monument, the university of Paris)
University of Paris (Q209842) : Sorbonne => "Former university in Paris, France from the middle ages to 1970". 
Sorbonne University (Q41497113) => "French university located in Paris, created in 2018 from the merger of UniversitÃ© Paris".
Sorbonne (Q214654) => "Historical university building in Paris, France"

Issue n.3: the Noble Prize Medal
Since the two medals have been melted down(at the start of World War I, France put out a call for gold to fund the war effort, so Curie offered to have her two medals melted down), what we have today as an evidence of the prize is the two documents attesting the prize. We manage to find the documents recorded, especially on the Nobel website, but without succeeding.
